# Swift UI Take Home Project

This is a Swift UI demonstration.

## Installation

This project can be cloned or downloaded as a zip file. Please use the master branch.
We are using swift 5.4 wih Xcode 12.5. No dependencies required. 

## Notes on requirements

This was a good learning experience. I haven't put swift ui into production apps before so I learned it this weekend. I have no prior experiencee with VIPER. I read up on viper and implemented what I learned. 

There are 2 branches to look at. I did a vanilla Swift UI imprementation first on the main branch.
I follwed Apple's user interface guideline which requires clean navigation bars. So I did not add backgrounds to the the nav buttons up there. 

The 2nd branch called dev-viper. I have it working but ultimately was unable to refactor the presentor or interactor to my satisfaction.

## Usage

Just 3 screens including Page 1, Page 2 and a logout modal.

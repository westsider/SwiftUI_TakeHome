# Swift UI Take Home Project

This is a Swift UI demonstration.

## Installation

This project can be cloned or downloaded as a zip file. Please use the master branch.
We are using swift 5.4 wih Xcode 12.5. No dependencies required. 

## Notes on requirements

Although Im aware of Swift UI I hven't used it before so I learned it this weekend. I have no prior experiencee with VIPER.  I read up on viper and implemented what I learned. 

There are 2 branches to look at. 

First I did a vanilla Swift UI imprementation on the main branch. I follwed Apple's user interface guideline which require clean navigation bars. So I did not add backgrounds to the the nav buttons.  This would have caused the apple app store to reject this app.

Second I did another branch called dev-viper. I have it working but ultimately I would like to refactor the presentor and interactor to satisfy the VIPER design pattern.

## Usage

Just 3 screens including Page 1, Page 2 and a logout modal.

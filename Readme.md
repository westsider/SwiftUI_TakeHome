# Swift UI Take Home Project

This is a Swift UI demonstration.

## Installation

This project can be cloned or downloaded as a zip file. Please use the master branch.
We are using swift 5.4 with Xcode 12.5. No dependencies required. 

## Notes on requirements

Although I am aware of Swift UI, I have not used it before. I took the opportunity to  learn it this weekend. I also have had no prior experience with VIPER and so I also  read up on viper and implemented what I learned. 

There are 2 branches to look at. 

First I did a vanilla Swift UI implementation on the main branch. The request was for the nav buttons to have backgrounds. This does not follow Apple's design guidelines and would have caused a rejection during app store review. So I did not add backgrounds to the the nav buttons.

Second, I did another branch called dev-viper. I have it working but ultimately I would like to refactor the presenter and interactor to satisfy the viper design pattern.

## Usage

Just 3 screens including Page 1, Page 2 and a logout modal.
